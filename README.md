# Master-Badge
programming a prototype of smart cracha, where the idea is that it will be possible for hierarchical superiors to communicate with their collaborators, also being able to see their location in real time. On the collaborator's part, he could answer a few things briefly, such as "I'm busy" or "I'm on my way".

the Master Badge was a project created to participate in the INOVA SENAI competition, where my team and I got the first place in para√≠ba.
